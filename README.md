# Visualizing Linear regression




## The essence of the algorithm 
We try and fit a curve on a scatter plot of random points. The way the algorithm learns to is where Machine Learning comes in. Fortunately unlike other Machine Learning algorithms, we can see how the model learns.  
## The smallest heading
Given a any random data set which has a set of x and y values, lets try and fit a line through this curve.  
```python
x  =  np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) 
y  =  np . array ([ 4 , 6 , 7 , 15 , 13 ]) 
```

Maximum likelyhood

![](https://github.com/siddharth-cse/Linear-regression-MLE/blob/main/graph.svg)

Here we try to find the Max likelyhood for every pair on points $x_i,y_i$ with m features. And for each point we do a MLE for mu and sigma.Max likelyhood= Each point closer to regression line implies probability of finding that point (x,y) is highly likey. So the joint probability = product of all individual likelyhoods.
